#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char s[] = "america";
    puts(s);

    /***
    "america" is a character array.
    Character array declare this format
    char character_array_name[character_array_size];
    But here write only char s.
    char s means it takes input only one character.
    But here give a string character.
    Here a character_array_size is missing,
    And In C programming we close every line with ;.
    But here ; also missing.

    So, We need to declare this code like.
    Correct Code:
    char s[] = "america";
    ***/
    return 0;
}
